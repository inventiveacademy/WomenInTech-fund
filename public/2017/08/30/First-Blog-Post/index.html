Starting with a document written in French by Luigi Menabrea, an Italian mathematician, Lovelace added extensive notes to the English translation, including the world’s first computer algorithm.<br><br>The Analytical Engine was intended to count Bernoulli numbers, but Babbage was unsuccessful in getting the funding to build his machine. Notably, Lovelace was able to see the potential for the computer beyond simple math.<br><br>“Many persons who are not conversant with mathematical studies imagine that because the business of [Babbage’s Analytical Engine] is to give its results in numerical notation, the nature of its processes must consequently be arithmetical and numerical, rather than algebraical and analytical. This is an error. The engine can arrange and combine its numerical quantities exactly as if they were letters or any other general symbols; and in fact it might bring out its results in algebraical notation, were provisions made accordingly,” Lovelace wrote in the Sketch of the Analytical Engine Invented by Charles Babbage, Esq.<br><br></p><br>    </div><br>    <p></p><br></body><br></html></div></article></div></main><footer><div class="paginator"><a class="prev" href="/2017/08/30/Another-Blog-Post/">prev</a><a class="next" href="/2017/08/30/Sample-Blog-Post/">next</a></div><div class="copyright"><p>&copy; 2017 <a href="http://yoursite.com">Trinity | Shalay | Tanner</a>.<br>Powered by <a href="https://hexo.io/" target="_blank">Hexo</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/Dreyer/hexo-theme-artemis" target="_blank">Artemis</a>.</p></div></footer></div></body></html>
