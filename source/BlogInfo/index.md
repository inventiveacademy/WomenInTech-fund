            <h2>When women in tech plumeted</h2>In 1984 the amount of women in tech was 37% as our knowledge of electronics started growning we started selling games to boys more than girls which started making the tech side of the world more males than female but as we get more and more towards the tech age we are starting to get to the point of robotic servers instead of humans leaving little jobs for humans to do so since females don't know anything about tech we females would be left out of work.</p>
